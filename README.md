# Hypixel BOT
Welcome to my repository! Well this was a side project I was doing, and I saw lots of **Hypixel Bots** on the [Code Creation forum](https://hypixel.net/forums/code-creations.65/)
and none of them was open-source so I decided to make my own one.

## Requirements
#### Node requirements (already on package.json)
* [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
* [Hypixel-API-NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hypixel-api-nodejs) (I'll create my own wrapper)
* [humanize-duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration)
#### Other requirements
* Hypixel API Key (run `/api new` on mc.hypixel.net)
* [Discord BOT Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications/me)
* Prior basic *JavaScript* knowledge

## More information about the project!
I know the code in this project at the moment is *so* messy, i'll be pushing updates to make the code understandable and more organized!
Thanks for understanding.
